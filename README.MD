# React for Designers

React & JavaScript have become staples in the modern web-developers toolbox. Say
what you will about the state of the JavaScript nation, but neither of these
technologies are going anywhere soon. The goal behind this series is to
introduce the fundamentals of JavaScript and React to someone coming from a
background in traditional front-end design  that has had solid exposure to HTML
and CSS but tends to tip-toe around JavaScript (I'm looking at you all the
copy-paster's out there!) Don't worry, we'll start slow and build on some
fundamentals each lesson.

## Prerequisites
* Familiarity with HTML, CSS and a dash of JS
* A command line
* `git`
* `node v6.7.0` or greater

## Workflow

Each lesson will begin by checking out the relevant branch, installing any new
dependencies and then running the tests. Some lessons will involve running a
development server and will have some visuals, others will not. Directions for
each lesson will be in both the readme and the tests. Assume that if you have
broken tests, that those will need to be repaired in order to complete that
lesson.

I really hope you enjoy this series. Feedback is always appreciated in the form
of issues or a pull reuqest!

Lets get started!
