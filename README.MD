# Lesson 0

Ok, you've reached your first assignment. There's a failing test. Broken tests
are clearly not a good thing, to take a look at the intro.js module and make
sure the message is what we are expecting. Once your build is 'green' (all tests
passing) save your changes and move onto lesson-1.

```
git checkout lesson-1
```
