# Lesson 0 - Primitives for Primates

Ok, you've reached your first assignment, lets get your environment setup.

```
# install all of your node modules
npm install

# run the first test
npm test -- intro
```

Ok, if you've sucessfully run the above two commands, you should see a failing
test. This one is easy enough. Take a look at the test file and see what it's
doing! There are comments in-line in the file that should help you resolve the
issues.

Make the changes, and then rerun your test: `npm test -- intro`. Once that test
is all "green", commit your changes!
